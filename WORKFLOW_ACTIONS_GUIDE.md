# GitHub Actions Workflow Guide

## Current Workflows (After Cleanup)

After removing duplication, we now have **3 focused workflows**:

### 1. **CI - Tests and Coverage** (`ci.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Run tests and generate coverage reports
- **Triggers**: Push/PR to main/develop branches
- **What it does**:
  - Runs pytest with coverage for both `src/` and `api/` directories
  - Uploads coverage reports to Codecov
  - Includes branch coverage metrics

### 2. **Python Code Quality** (`python-quality.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Code quality checks and linting
- **Triggers**: Push/PR to main/develop (only when Python files change)
- **What it does**:
  - Black code formatting check
  - PyLint analysis with scoring
  - Flake8 linting
  - MyPy type checking
  - Bandit security analysis
  - Safety dependency vulnerability check
  - Generates quality report artifact

### 3. **CodeQL Security Scan** (`codeql.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Security vulnerability scanning
- **Triggers**: Push/PR to main/develop + weekly schedule (Mondays 3am UTC)
- **What it does**:
  - Static code analysis for security vulnerabilities
  - Uploads results to GitHub Security tab
  - Generates security artifacts

## How to View Visual Results

```

## Monitoring and Alerts

### üìß **Notifications**
- GitHub will send email notifications for failed workflows
- You can customize notification settings in GitHub Settings

### üì± **Mobile App**
- GitHub mobile app shows workflow status
- Push notifications for workflow results

### üîî **Slack/Teams Integration**
- Connect GitHub to Slack/Teams for workflow notifications
- Get real-time updates on build status

## Troubleshooting Failed Workflows

### Common Issues:
1. **Test Failures**: Check test logs in Actions tab
2. **Coverage Drop**: Review coverage reports in Codecov
3. **Quality Issues**: Check PyLint/Flake8 output in quality report
4. **Security Issues**: Review CodeQL alerts in Security tab

### Debug Steps:
1. Click on failed workflow run
2. Expand failed job
3. Check logs for specific error messages
4. Review artifacts for detailed reports
